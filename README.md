# Master’s Thesis – Code Repository

This repository contains example code for the methods used in my master’s thesis.

## Getting Started

To use the code:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>

2. **Install the requirements**
   - Python packages are listed in requirements.txt. Install them using
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

  - R packages are listed within the R scrips themselves.

## Data Access
The necessary data is provided by the Department of Biology at NTNU and the Gjærevoll Centre. This data is not included in the repository. Once you have access to it, place it according to the expected paths in the code or make personal adjustments.


## Running the Code
- Preprocessing for the two-step approach: Run dataloader.R
- Fitting the animal model: Run INLA.R
